# Console Builder

##How to compile

Because this is an early version, you will have to edit the paths manually.

Therefore go in MainWindow.xaml.cs and edit dirPath, csProj and bubbleFile variables.

##How to use it

1. Click on Load to load all the possible commands that are available
2. Click on Build to build the file dependencies and load them into the app
4. Compile ExcelsiorConsole.

**NOTE**: if it says that the project was changed from outside, accept it's changes. It is supposed to happen as the app edits the .csproj file.
