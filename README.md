# Console Builder

##How to compile

Because this is an early version, you will have to edit the paths manually.

Therefore go in MainWindow.xaml.cs and edit dirPath, csProj and modulesTxt variables.

##How to use it

1. Click on Load to load all the possible commands that are available
2. Run on Build
3. Go in the ExcelsiorConsole and search for Bubble/bubble.tt, enter it and click CTRL+S for it to compile
4. Compile ExcelsiorConsole.

**NOTE**: if it says that the project was changed from outside, accept it's changes. It is supposed to happen as the app edits the .csproj file.
